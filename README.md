## Overview

- NiceTab is an `open source` browser extension that makes managing your browser tabs quick and convenient.
- Named `NiceTab` with the hope that it would be a "nice" tab management tool.
- Similar to other tab management extensions like `OneTab`, `Toby`, `SessionBuddy`, `N-Tab` and `KepTab`. it supports browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and any Chromium based browser.
- Developed using `React` and based on the [`wxt framework`](https://wxt.dev/), which provides built-in templates for `Vanilla`, `Vue`, `React`, `Svelte`, and `Solid`.
- The UI is powered by the popular [`Ant Design`](https://ant-design.antgroup.com/) library.

## Motivation

I personally get anxious when there are too many tabs open, and switching to a specific tab among them is a hassle. After using OneTab, managing tabs became much easier, improving efficiency and saving memory, so I used it for a long time.

However, I felt a few aspects weren't quite smooth:

- Group names are lost after exporting and re-importing tabs.
- Because renaming group names isn't persisted, I gave up on renaming them. Once many groups accumulate, locating a specific group is difficult.
- The right-click menu on the extension icon often shows several duplicate menu groups, but only one group of menus actually works, you have to try each to find out.
- Sometimes I just want to bookmark some tabs without closing them, but OneTab lacks an option for that (a personal preference).
- There's no straightforward way to create a new group within OneTab directly and move tabs from an existing group into that new group.
- And a few more smaller issues...

Additionally, the `N-Tab` extension is open-source, but after reviewing it, I found the tech stack a bit outdated, making it difficult to contribute effectively.

Based on the above reasons, I decided to develop the `NiceTab` extension. incorporate additional features upon some features from `OneTab`, `N-Tab`, to enhance the experience.
